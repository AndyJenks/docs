*************************************
Welcome to the SRCF's documentation!
*************************************

Whether you're a society webmaster, budding sysadmin or just an interested browser, these pages should contain all the necessary answers to help guide you in whatever you wish to make with our services.

As a quick reminder, the **Student-Run Computing Facility**, known as the *SRCF*, exists as a university society to provide useful and flexible computing and network services for University of Cambridge staff and students of all degrees of ability.

Head over to our `main website <http://www.srcf.net/>`_ for more information on what we offer. In the meantime, you can find lots of information on these pages on how to get started with our systems.

.. important::
   The SRCF is run by volunteers who help to maintain its services for hundreds of societies. Our services are free and therefore we rely on donations. If you can, please `consider donating <https://www.srcf.net/donate>`_.
