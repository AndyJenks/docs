Files and transfer
------------------

Your home directory on SRCF servers is ``/home/<crsid>``.  Society account files can be found at ``/societies/<name>``.  These directories are private to you / society admins.

All accounts also come with a "public" directory (these are located at ``/public/home/<crsid>`` and ``/public/societies/<name>`` respectively).  This includes your website root ``public_html``, but you're free to use them as you wish.

You can use SFTP or SCP to transfer files between your SRCF account and your personal computer.  Mac and Linux come with ``scp`` for per-file transfer; you may prefer a graphical client -- options include WinSCP on Windows, or Cyberduck for Mac/Windows.
