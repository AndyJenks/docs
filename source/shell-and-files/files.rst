Files and transfer
------------------

Your home directory on SRCF servers is ``/home/<crsid>``.  Society account files can be found at ``/societies/<socname>``.  These directories are private to you / society admins.

All accounts also come with a "public" directory (these are located at ``/public/home/<crsid>`` and ``/public/societies/<socname>`` respectively).  This includes your website root ``public_html``, but you're free to use them as you wish.

You can use SFTP or SCP to transfer files between your SRCF account and your personal computer.  Mac and Linux come with ``scp`` for per-file transfer; you may prefer a graphical client -- options include WinSCP on Windows, or Cyberduck for Mac/Windows.

Quotas
~~~~~~

We provide users with 2GB of space for their personal files, and each society account also comes with 2GB of its own space.  If you run out, you may request additional quota from the sysadmins.  For larger increases, you may be asked to justify the need, and the SRCF committee may need to approve it.

Consider searching for cache files in your home directory that may be taking up unnecessary space, or compressing large files (e.g. high-resolution photos on websites).
