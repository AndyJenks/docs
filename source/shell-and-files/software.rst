Software and installation
-------------------------

Our main shell server includes a plethora of Linux software, some of which can be used graphically over a VNC session.

If something is missing that you'd like to use, we may be able to install it for you.  The usual constraints are that it should be available in `Ubuntu's repositories <https://packages.ubuntu.com>`__, and suitable for a multi-user environment.  You may `contact the sysadmins <https://www.srcf.net/contact>`__ to request an installation.

As we run long-term support releases of Ubuntu, you may find that the versions we have installed are rather outdated (typically several years behind, patched by Ubuntu with security fixes but without new features).

In some cases, you may be able to set up or install your own copy of software within your (or a society's) home directory.  However, it is then your responsibility to keep it updated â€“ accounts with security vulnerabilities may be suspended without notice.

Port binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running programs that bind to ports, please ensure you only bind to ``localhost`` so they're not publicly accessible, and choose a random high-numbered port to try and avoid conflicts with other users.
