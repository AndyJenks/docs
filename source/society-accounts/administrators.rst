Administrators
--------------

Each society account has a list of *admins*: SRCF users who manage the account and its services.  This includes access to the account in the control panel, permissions to edit files inside ``/societies/<socname>``, and receiving administrative email sent to ``<socname>-admins@srcf.net``.  This list may also be used by an account's website to limit page access to current admins.

We recommend that you keep your own handover documentation, covering what services and software a society account is using.

When a society account admin leaves the university without taking steps to retain access to their SRCF account, they may  be dropped from the list of admins.  A society with no admins is considered *unmaintained*, at which point some services will be suspended.  To maintain continuity of society accounts, we recommend keeping at least two admins at all times.
