Access and administrators
-------------------------

Each society account has a list of *admins*: SRCF users who manage the account and its services.  This includes access to the account in the control panel, permissions to edit files inside ``/societies/<name>``, and receiving administrative email sent to ``<name>-admins@srcf.net``.

If you are a prospective admin seeking access to an existing account, you should first contact the existing admins to request access.  If you're unable to make contact with them, you may `ask the system administrators <https://www.srcf.net/contact>`_ for assistance.

When a society account admin leaves the university without taking steps to retain access to their SRCF account, they may  be dropped from the list of admins.  A society with no admins is considered *unmaintained*, at which point some services will be suspended.  To maintain continuity of society accounts, we recommend keeping at least two admins at all times, and you should ensure handovers happen promptly.
