Frequently Asked Questions: SRCF Membership Lists
-------------------------------------------------

Why have I been subscribed to mailing lists called Soc-SRCF, Soc-SRCF-users, Soc-SRCF-maintenance and/or Soc-SRCF-social?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SRCF needs to be able to keep in contact with our users at all times
(a requirement imposed upon us). We therefore automatically subscribe
you to Soc-SRCF, Soc-SRCF-users and Soc-SRCF-maintenance shortly after
creating your account. We will also subscribe you to Soc-SRCF-social if
you requested this during the signup process.

These are very low-traffic mailing lists—just a few messages per
year—and we do our best to ensure that the messages sent are relevant to
as many people as possible. We hope that you will not consider this to
be an inconvenience.

What sort of message will be sent to these mailing lists?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Soc-SRCF** contains *members* of the SRCF (membership is for life),
   and receives messages from the committee about such things as:

   -  major society event announcements (e.g. AGMs, garden parties,
      etc.)—usually about three events per year
   -  rare but important society administrative information (e.g.
      constitutional amendments) which affect all members

-  **Soc-SRCF-users** contains *users* of the SRCF (which only applies
   whilst you have CUDN access, as per the Terms of Service), and
   receives messages from the sysadmins which are important to account
   holders, for example:

   -  urgent messages which require the attention of every SRCF user
      (e.g. security compromises)—very infrequent, we hope!
   -  rare but important system administrative information (e.g. terms
      of service changes) which affect all users

-  **Soc-SRCF-maintenance** is used for announcements about planned and
   ongoing system unavailability (downtime), and announcements about
   important changes to service provision (e.g. increased quotas,
   software changes which may require your action, etc.). If you are not
   interested in receiving such messages, you are welcome to
   unsubscribe, but many users find these announcements useful.
-  **Soc-SRCF-social** is a more open mailing list for announcement and
   discussion of social events (pub meets, LAN parties, garden parties,
   the annual UCS machine room tour, etc.). Any SRCF member is welcome
   to join or leave this list at any time.

I would like to unsubscribe from Soc-SRCF and/or Soc-SRCF-users.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because we must be able to contact everyone with an SRCF account, you
may only unsubscribe from **Soc-SRCF** or **Soc-SRCF-users** if you are
willing to give up your membership of the SRCF and access to its
services. If this is what you want, please e-mail the sysadmins
<soc-srcf-admin@lists.cam.ac.uk> saying you want to terminate your
membership.

Usually, when you leave the University and lose your access to our
services, you will be automatically unsubscribed from Soc-SRCF-users—but
*not* Soc-SRCF as you remain a SRCF member for life and are still
welcome to attend SRCF events. As above, if you wish to give up this
right you should contact the sysadmin team.

I would like to unsubscribe from Soc-SRCF-maintenance and/or Soc-SRCF-social.
