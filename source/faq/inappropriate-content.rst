Frequently Asked Questions: Inappropriate Content
-------------------------------------------------

What is the SRCF's policy on inappropriate content?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inappropriate content is deemed to be any content that is in
contravention of the CUDN rules and guidelines, or JANET AUP. Amongst
other things these rules prohibit using the CUDN to store or transmit
material that is obscene, defamatory, offensive or violates a third
party's copyright. If such material comes to the attention of the
sysadmins or committee the responsible user will be required to remove
it. In the case of gross and flagrant breaches of the rules the
sysadmins may remove the material themselves. The account of a user
responsible for prohibited material may be suspended and they may be
reported to the Computing Service.

So in summary, don't do it!

What should I do if I find something I consider to be inappropriate hosted by the SRCF?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please let the user or society that controls the content know that you
consider it inappropriate, and explain why with reference to the SRCF's
Terms of Service, CUDN rules and guidelines, or JANET AUP. For pages
with URLs of the form:

For pages with URLs of the form:

``http://socname.soc.srcf.net/`` or

to approach them yourselves, then you should forward your concerns to
the committee: committee@srcf.net.
