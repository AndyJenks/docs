Frequently Asked Questions: Obtaining an Account

Is it Ok to apply for SRCF membership when all I really want is to run my club's website, rather than my own?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is absolutely fine.

I need hosting for a commercial website â€” can I use the SRCF?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our servers are connected to the Internet via the Cambridge University
Data Network (CUDN), and as such all users of the SRCF are bound by its
rules, which explicitly forbids any use of the CUDN for commercial or
for-profit activities. Therefore it is not possible for commercial
websites to be hosted on our machines. For more details, please refer to
the `Authorization for Use of the CUDN
Rules <http://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/governance/information-services-committee/rules-and-guidelines/other-guidelines/network-use/cudn-rules>`__
and the `Rules Made by the Information Services
Committee <http://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/governance/information-services-committee/rules-and-guidelines/rules>`__.

Our interpretation of these rules is that including a sponsor's logo on
a society website is acceptable, however selling web space or
advertising is not.

Furthermore, the SRCF server is maintained by a group of volunteer
sysadmins who donate their time freely to ensure that our services can
continue to operate smoothly. We do not feel that it is appropriate to
ask that the sysadmins give up their time in this way so that others can
make money.
