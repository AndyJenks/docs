Comparing Timeout with other platforms
--------------------------------------

Timeout runs on the open source software Greenlight/BigBlueButton and as such has both several benefits and drawbacks compared to other existing platforms. Comments marked in * are not normally true and are rather a result of pandemic-related extensions.
