Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Terms of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As any other service we offer, use of Timeout is subject to specific terms of service. Our `general terms of service <https://www.srcf.net/tos>`__ still applies.

* As Timeout is still in its early stages, please understand that downtime may occur at any given moment. We have worked hard on putting measures in place to prevent this, but given that the SRCF itself is still learning the ins and outs of this new system, we ask you to recognize this as a possibility.
* Timeout is a service we foresee being heavily used. For this reason, please do not leave meetings open for hours on end or set your webcam quality to anything excessive for long periods of time. Rememeber that the quality of Timeout is in part dependent on its users and whether they respect others using it.
* Do not misuse our systems. Any attempt to backdoor, tamper with, or access unauthorized information will be swiftly dealt with and reported to the relevant authorities.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. As is stated in our general ToS, we are not responsible for any attempts to access your account, including all possible events occurring following said access.
* Use of Timeout for work not directly related to the University is allowed as we understand the value of keeping in touch with friends and family during these trying times. However, please be sensible about this.

Privacy concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As usual, your use of Timeout is fully compliant with `the SRCF privacy policy <https://www.srcf.net/privacy>`__, but here we note a few other privacy-related concerns:

.. note::

   All the items listed below are a consequence of the technical set-up of BBB and while they may be modified by us it would take a significant amount of effort and time, which is currently not seen as a priority by those responsible for hosting Timeout.

Recording
^^^^^^^^^

When a room is created that allows recordings (ie. the recording button is present), BBB will always record the session *independently of whether the button is actually pressed*. We have chosen to globally enable recordings on our system as we see this as a useful feature, if used correctly. By default, these files are securely stored on our system and deleted after two weeks. For this reason, you may request a retroactive recording of your session, even if you forgot to press the record button.

As of this moment, BBB stores recordings on an easily enumerable URL, which poses a potential security risk to any sensitive content recorded. Your room recording availability settings can be configured in Greenlight (what you use to create rooms) but the URL generated for viewing of this recording is out of Greenlight's control. The best solution in this case is for you to directly request us to download the recording, after which we may distribute it to you and purge it from our system. While we don't expect this to be a major problem (and we will monitor access to room recordings in order to detect any suspicious behavior), it is sensible for you to follow the instructions above if your session includes any sensitive or private content.

Cache and logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BBB has a wide variety of dependencies, each of which log activities. This means the following are stored on our system:

* The number of sessions tied to your account
* When and how many times you hosted a particular session
* The presentation uploaded by you to BBB
* All interactions with rooms including who joined and when they left
* The IP addresses of participants

Note that most of these logs are rotated every 8 days, so they will be purged from our system at some point.

URL generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Greenlight generates URLs with the first three letters of your name. There is currently active work being done to change this.

Data protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GDPR lists several important considerations, especially:

* The right to request a (machine readable) aggregate of all private data stored
* The right to have all personal data be erased

Both pose challenges in the context of BBB, especially when considering that rooms can be joined anonymously. This means that we may not be able to identify all private information connected to a user easily, even though it is clearly personal, e.g., webcam recordings of a room joined to as a guest with a pseudonym.
