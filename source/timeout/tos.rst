Last updated: 20/05/2020

Terms of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with any other service we offer, use of Timeout is subject to specific terms of service. Our `general terms of service <https://www.srcf.net/tos>`__ still applies.

* As Timeout is still in its early stages, please understand that downtime may occur at any given moment. We have worked hard on putting measures in place to prevent this, but given that the SRCF itself is still learning the ins and outs of this new system, we ask you to recognize this as a possibility.
* Timeout is a service we foresee being heavily used. For this reason, please do not leave meetings open for hours on end or set your webcam quality to anything excessive for long periods of time. Rememeber that the quality of Timeout is in part dependent on its users and whether they respect others using it.
* Do not misuse our systems. Any attempt to backdoor, tamper with, or access unauthorized information will be swiftly dealt with and reported to the relevant authorities.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. As is stated in our general ToS, we are not responsible for any attempts to access your account, including all possible events occurring following said access.
* Use of Timeout for work not directly related to the University is allowed as we understand the value of keeping in touch with friends and family during these trying times. However, please be sensible about this.

Privacy policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following privacy applies when using Timeout and all of its related services. 

.. warning::

   Note that `the SRCF privacy policy <https://www.srcf.net/privacy>`__, which is more geared towards our other services, does not apply when using Timeout.

.. note::

   All the items listed below are a consequence of the technical set-up of BBB and while they may be modified by us it would take a significant amount of effort and time, which is currently not seen as a priority by those responsible for hosting Timeout.

The SRCF have set up this instance of BigBlueButton as a pilot for faculty, staff and students at Cambridge University to use for online learning during the closure of the university due to measures related to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Timeout only collects information necessary to run this instance successfully and is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We have prepared this privacy policy to describe our practices regarding the personal information that may be collected while using Timeout.

The SRCF does not use the personal information we collect about you for any commercial or other purpose than providing you with this service. Your privacy is one of our highest priorities when designing Timeout.

Data controlling entity and contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This service is run by::

   The Student-Run Computing Facility
   Cambridge University
   17 Mill lane, CUSU
   Cambridge CB2 1RX

You can contact the operators of this service at:  ``support@srcf.net``.

Your rights
^^^^^^^^^^^

As a user of Timeout, you have the following rights:

* The right to confirmation whether and which personally identifiable information about you is being processed, information about this data, further information on the data processing activities and a copy of all processed data.
* The right to correction and completion of false or incomplete data about you.
* The right to delete all of your personally identifiable information, as long as retention is not required to fulfill legal obligations.
* The right to receive a copy of all data we hold on you and the transfer of this data to another service provider in case you request it.
* The right to file a complaint with the responsible data protection agency in case you conclude that we processed or distributed your personal data in a way that is not compliant with this privacy policy or legal regulations.
* The right to know with whom we share your data.
* The right to retract consent for all further data processing

Summary of collected and processed data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All data collected from Timeout will be deleted as soon as the technical purpose of this data has been reached, and there are no legal requirements necessitating the retention of this data, as long as no deviating practice is documented below.

Data type: Log and system files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Type and version of your web browser
* Your operating system
* The website from which you switched to our site (Referrer URL)
* Timestamp of your access
* Your IP Address
* The name of the room you joined
* The name you chose for joining that room
* Start and end time of that room
* The number of users in that room

Why we collect this data:

This data is automatically submitted by your client. We use this data to operate our service. For example, we need your IP address to identify problems in our log files, and the number of room users to equally balance load across our cluster.

Data type: Data transfer in rooms (sessions)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Your username
* Audio data you send to the room
* Video data you send (screensharing, webcam)
* Uploaded pictures and slides
* Chat messages
* Contents of the shared notes
* Polling results

Why we collect this data:

This data is the core of the web conferencing system, and as such processed by our servers. Of course, this data is only processed in case you use the corresponding service, i.e., explicitly enable your webcam.

For sessions where the host did not configure recordings, all data related to the session is deleted as soon as it ends. Furthermore, there are sessions that are being recorded, e.g., as they are a university lecture the lecturer wants to share with students who could not make it to the live session. In case a session is supposed to be recorded, we will inform you before you join the room, and explicitly request your consent to the recording.

Data type: Transfer of data to third parties
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

Why we collect this data:

Timeout also supports showing external videos to participants in a session. Even though we do not share any data with these external parties, as these resources are directly requested by participants, metadata might be send to the operators of corresponding video platforms.

Data type: Cookies
""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Session Cookies

Why we collect this data:

We only use functional cookies that are necessary for the operation of our service, by associating multiple requests from a client, e.g., if you switch from your home-view to your account settings in the webinterface.

Data type: Account data
"""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Your name
* Your CRSid

Why we collect this data:

When you sign in with Raven, we create a Timeout user account associated to your CRSid. The default full name is retrieved from `the University Lookup Directory <https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/collaboration/lookup>`__, which you are free to modify afterwards. This data is necessary for providing the service and authenticating you to your account.

Data processing details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security
""""""""

Data shared with us is encrypted. On clients and our servers, it will be processed in plain-text. At the moment, Timeout does not support end-to-end encryption.

We operate this service following good practices of system and network engineering, and strive to install security updates as soon as they become available. Furthermore, as set out above, we limit the amount of personal information stored in our systems. Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Note that no passwords are stored on our system as we authenticate via Raven.

Log files
"""""""""

Timeout reduces logging to the necessary minimum. Nonetheless, collected data may include:

* Type and Version of your Webbrowser
* Your operating system
* The website from which you were redirected to our service
* The exact websites you visited on our service
* Timestamps of your accesses
* The IPv4/IPv6 addresses from which you access our service
* The names of rooms you visit
* Your phone number if you dial-in via your phone
* Metadata of the conference system (start/end of sessions, number of users, the name you selected when joining a room)

We collect this data to provide, improve, and secure the service we are providing. Your data will be deleted after seven days, if a longer retention is not necessary to solve immanent technical issues. In any case, it will not be retained longer than legally allowed.

Cookies
"""""""

We only use session cookies to enable us to provide the service we offer to you. We do not use any third-party cookies. In case an external video is shared in a conference, these might lead to the operator of that service setting and reading cookies.

Removal of Cookies: You can prevent cookies from being set and read in your browsers settings at any time. In case you prevent cookies for our website, functionality might be limited.

Contact via email
"""""""""""""""""

In case you contact us via email, we will retain the full emails you send to us until the request you had has been handled. Messages may be retained longer if they hold legal relevance, e.g., if you inform us of a crime committed via our platform.

Web conferencing system
"""""""""""""""""""""""

To offer our services, we use the open-source software BigBlueButton, together with the opens-source frontend Greenlight for managing and creating rooms. Using the open WebRTC protocol, this software stack enables you to share audio, video, text messages and drawings with others. This data includes:

* Audio and video data of you, e.g., your voice, your picture, or your desktop, depending on whether you use these features when you are joining a conference.
* The settings you choose, e.g., whether you share audio/video streams, and which username you chose for joining
* Whatever your write in the chat
* The presentations you upload
* Results of votes conducted in sessions

In case a room is **configured to be recorded**, we store the audio, video, chat, and drawing contributions made in that session for an indefinite time. In case you are trying to join a session that is being recorded, we will inform you about this before you join the session and request your consent to the recording. At the moment, it is sadly technically not possible to selectively record only contributions from participants that consented to being recorded. Hence, in case you do not consent to a recording, it is sadly not possible to join such a session.

Sharing of Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General data sharing
""""""""""""""""""""

We only share your personal data for the reasons outlined below:

* You explicitly consent.
* If it is necessary to provide this service to you, e.g., when using phone dial-in, you data is shared with our SIP provider speakup.nl
* If we are legally obliged to share this data, e.g., with law enforcement, to comply with applicable law. Up to this point we have not received any requests for data from any law enforcement agency.

Recordings
""""""""""

When a room is created that allows recordings (ie. the recording button is present), BBB will always record the session *independently of whether the button is actually pressed*. For this reason, **you may request a retroactive recording of your session, even if you forgot to press the record button**. We have chosen to globally enable recordings on our system as we see this as a useful feature, if used correctly. By default, these raw video files are securely stored on our system and deleted after seven days. These raw files are processed and cut according to the markers you set when you press stop/start recording. The outcome of this video processing is what is stored on our systems indefinitely and made available to you (the host) and to any other parties you share it with.

As of this moment, BBB stores recordings on an enumerable URL, which poses a potential security risk to any sensitive content recorded. Your room recording availability settings can be configured in Greenlight (what you use to create rooms) but the URL generated for viewing of this recording is out of Greenlight's control. The best solution in this case is for you to directly request us to download the recording, after which we may distribute it to you and purge it from our system. While we don't expect this to be a major problem (and we will monitor access to room recordings in order to detect any suspicious behavior), it is sensible for you to follow the instructions above if your session includes any sensitive or private content.

By default, recordings are not publicly accessible. However, at the discretion of a room's hosts, recording can be made public or shared with others directly via our platform or as downloaded files. As outlined in the previous section, we will solicit your consent to a session being recorded and potentially shared before you can join a room to be recorded. In case you want to retroactively widthdraw your consent to a recording, please contact ``support@srcf.net``. However, please note that the recording may already have been shared publicly and/or outside of our platform.

Server statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We collect aggregate statistics to monitor the utilization, performance, and availability of our servers. While this data is agregated, and does not contain personally identifiable information, personally identifiable information may be utilized for computing these aggregate values, e.g., the number of users and rooms per cluster node. Personally identifiable information used during the computation of aggregate statistics is not stored. More specifically, we store (for an indefinite period of time):

* Details related to session management (creation, hosting, etc)
* The duration and time of each session
* The number of participants in each session

Server location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The servers we use for this service are provided by the SRCF, a society dedicated to providing computing services to all members of the University. All servers used in our service are located in Cambridge.

Changes to this privacy policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will change the Last Updated date above. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time for the latest on our privacy practices.

URL generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Greenlight generates URLs with the first three letters of your name. There is currently active work being done to change this.
 
For more technical information, please `visit this link <https://github.com/ichdasich/bbb-privacy>`__. Note that we may make changes to our platform that would make statements in the above link invalid.
