Terms of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with any other service we offer, use of Timeout is subject to specific terms of service. Our `general terms of service <https://www.srcf.net/tos>`__ still applies.

* As Timeout is still in its early stages, please understand that downtime may occur at any given moment. We have worked hard on putting measures in place to prevent this, but given that the SRCF itself is still learning the ins and outs of this new system, we ask you to recognize this as a possibility.
* Timeout is a service we foresee being heavily used. For this reason, please do not leave meetings open for hours on end or set your webcam quality to anything excessive for long periods of time. Rememeber that the quality of Timeout is in part dependent on its users and whether they respect others using it.
* Do not misuse our systems. Any attempt to backdoor, tamper with, or access unauthorized information will be swiftly dealt with and reported to the relevant authorities.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. As is stated in our general ToS, we are not responsible for any attempts to access your account, including all possible events occurring following said access.
* Use of Timeout for work not directly related to the University is allowed as we understand the value of keeping in touch with friends and family during these trying times. However, please be sensible about this.

Privacy policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following privacy applies when using Timeout and all of its related services. 

.. warning::

   Note that `the SRCF privacy policy <https://www.srcf.net/privacy>`__, which is more geared towards our other services, does not apply when using Timeout.

.. note::

   All the items listed below are a consequence of the technical set-up of BBB and while they may be modified by us it would take a significant amount of effort and time, which is currently not seen as a priority by those responsible for hosting Timeout.

The SRCF have set up this instance of BigBlueButton as a pilot for faculty, staff and students at Cambridge University to use for online learning during the closure of the university due to measures related to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Timeout only collects information necessary to run this instance successfully and is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We have prepared this privacy policy to describe our practices regarding the personal information that may be collected while using Timeout.

The SRCF does not use the personal information we collect about you for any commercial or other purpose than providing you with this service. Your privacy is one of our highest priorities when designing Timeout.

Introduction and contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This service is run by the Student-Run Computing Facility (referred to henceforth as "the SRCF", "the Society", "we", "our" or "us").

The latest version of this statement can be found on our website at https://docs.srcf.net/timeout/tos.html. The SRCF is the data controller for data held under this privacy statement. The SRCF Executive is the designated data protection contact, and are in charge of data protection matters. They can be contacted at ``data-protection@srcf.net``.

Please note: this statement only applies to data held by the SRCF for which it is the data controller. Timeout also processes data for which the SRCF is not the data controller, for example any content within a meeting provided by its participants. You should refer to the privacy statement of the controller of that data where this applies to you as a data subject.

Summary of collected and processed data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All data collected from Timeout will be deleted as soon as the technical purpose of this data has been reached, and there are no legal requirements necessitating the retention of this data, as long as no deviating practice is documented below.

Data type: Log and system files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Type and version of your web browser
* Your operating system
* The website from which you switched to our site (Referrer URL)
* Timestamp of your access
* Your IP Address
* The name of the room you joined
* The name you chose for joining that room
* Start and end time of that room
* The number of users in that room

Why we collect this data:

This data is automatically submitted by your client. We use this data to operate our service. For example, we need your IP address to identify problems in our log files, and the number of room users to equally balance load across our cluster.

Data type: Data transfer in rooms (sessions)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Your username
* Audio data you send to the room
* Video data you send (screensharing, webcam)
* Uploaded pictures and slides
* Chat messages
* Contents of the shared notes
* Polling results

Why we collect this data:

This data is the core of the web conferencing system, and as such processed by our servers. Of course, this data is only processed in case you use the corresponding service, i.e., explicitly enable your webcam.

For sessions where the host did not configure recordings, all data related to the session is deleted shortly after it ends. See the :ref:`Recordings<Recordings>` section for details on how recordings are processed.

Data type: Transfer of data to third parties
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

Why we collect this data:

Timeout also supports showing external videos to participants in a session. Even though we do not share any data with these external parties, as these resources are directly requested by participants, metadata might be send to the operators of corresponding video platforms.

Data type: Cookies
""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Session Cookies

Why we collect this data:

We only use functional cookies that are necessary for the operation of our service, by associating multiple requests from a client, e.g., if you switch from your home-view to your account settings in the webinterface.

Data type: Account data
"""""""""""""""""""""""

What this includes:

* Your name
* Your CRSid

Why we collect this data:

When you sign in with Raven, we create a Timeout user account associated to your CRSid. The default full name is retrieved from `the University Lookup Directory <https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/collaboration/lookup>`__, which you are free to modify afterwards. This data is necessary for providing the service and authenticating you to your account.

Data processing details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security
""""""""

Data shared with us is encrypted. On clients and our servers, it will be processed in plain-text. At the moment, Timeout does not support end-to-end encryption.

We operate this service following good practices of system and network engineering, and strive to install security updates as soon as they become available. Furthermore, as set out above, we limit the amount of personal information stored in our systems. Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Note that no passwords are stored on our system as we authenticate via Raven.

Log files
"""""""""

Timeout reduces logging to the necessary minimum. Nonetheless, collected data may include:

* Type and Version of your Webbrowser
* Your operating system
* The website from which you were redirected to our service
* The exact websites you visited on our service
* Timestamps of your accesses
* The IPv4/IPv6 addresses from which you access our service
* The names of rooms you visit
* Metadata of the conference system (start/end of sessions, number of users, the name you selected when joining a room)

We collect this data to provide, improve, and secure the service we are providing. Your data will be deleted after seven days, if a longer retention is not necessary to solve immanent technical issues. In any case, it will not be retained longer than legally allowed.

Cookies
"""""""

We only use session cookies to enable us to provide the service we offer to you. We do not use any third-party cookies. In case an external video is shared in a conference, these might lead to the operator of that service setting and reading cookies.

Removal of Cookies: You can prevent cookies from being set and read in your browsers settings at any time. In case you prevent cookies for our website, functionality might be limited.

Contact via email
"""""""""""""""""

In case you contact us via email, we will retain the full emails you send to us until the request you had has been handled. Messages may be retained longer if they hold legal relevance, e.g., if you inform us of a crime committed via our platform.

Web conferencing system
"""""""""""""""""""""""

To offer our services, we use the open-source software BigBlueButton, together with the opens-source frontend Greenlight for managing and creating rooms. Using the open WebRTC protocol, this software stack enables you to share audio, video, text messages and drawings with others. This data includes:

* Audio and video data of you, e.g., your voice, your picture, or your desktop, depending on whether you use these features when you are joining a conference.
* The settings you choose, e.g., whether you share audio/video streams, and which username you chose for joining
* Whatever your write in the chat
* The presentations you upload
* Results of votes conducted in sessions

Sharing of Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We only share your personal data for the reasons outlined below:

* If it is necessary to provide this service to you. For example, your name is visible to participants of the same meeting.
* If we are legally obliged to share this data, e.g., with law enforcement, to comply with applicable law. Up to this point we have not received any requests for data from any law enforcement agency.

Server statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We collect aggregate statistics to monitor the utilization, performance, and availability of our servers. While this data is agregated, and does not contain personally identifiable information, personally identifiable information may be utilized for computing these aggregate values, e.g., the number of users and rooms per cluster node. Personally identifiable information used during the computation of aggregate statistics is not stored. More specifically, we store (for an indefinite period of time):

* Details related to session management (creation, hosting, etc)
* The duration and time of each session
* The number of participants in each session

Server location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The servers we use for this service are provided by the SRCF, a society dedicated to providing computing services to all members of the University. All servers used in our service are located in Cambridge.

.. _Recordings:

Recordings
^^^^^^^^^^
When a room is created, the host can choose to recording the room. We consider the host of the room to be the data controller, and the SRCF acts as the data processor.

When a room is created that allows recordings (i.e. the recording button is present), BBB will always record the entirety of the session *independently of whether the button is actually pressed*. After a meeting ends, the raw files are processed and cut according to the markers you set when you press stop/start recording.

At the moment, for technical reasons, the raw files are retained indefinitely after the meeting. For this reason, **you may request a retroactive recording of your session, even if you forgot to press the record button**. This policy is likely to change in the future as technology evolves.

By default, recordings are not publicly accessible. However, at the discretion of a room's hosts, recording can be made public or shared with others directly via our platform or as downloaded files. If a recording is made public, anyone with the url can access the recording.

Note that the url of the recording is obtained by combining the meeting id with the time the recording was made. Thus, a determined meeting participant may be able to find the recordings of other meetings held in the same room. If this is a concern, you should use a different from for each set of participants.

In case you are trying to join a session that is being recorded, we will inform you about this before you join the session and request your consent to the recording. Since we cannot selectively record only contributions from participants that consented to being recorded, in case you do not consent, it is sadly not possible to join such a session.

Changes to this privacy policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will change the Last Updated date above. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time for the latest on our privacy practices.
 
For more technical information, please `visit this link <https://github.com/ichdasich/bbb-privacy>`__. Note that we may make changes to our platform that would make statements in the above link invalid.

Your rights
^^^^^^^^^^^
You have the right to ask for:

* access to your personal information;
* the correction of any errors in your personal information;
* the erasure of your personal information;
* restriction on processing of your personal information pending correction or erasure; and
* the transfer of your personal information to a third party by electronic means.

Some of these rights are not automatic, and we reserve the right to discuss with you why we might not comply with a request from you to exercise them.

If you have any questions or concerns about your personal information, please get in touch with the designated data protection contact listed at the top of this document. Please note that in dealing with your request, we may also need to share details of your request with entities with whom we have shared your personal data.

If you remain unhappy with the way your information is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF or online at https://ico.org.uk/.
