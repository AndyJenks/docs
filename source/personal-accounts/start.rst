Getting started
---------------

To start with, you'll need to `create a personal account <https://control.srcf.net/signup>`__.  This will allow you to use the control panel to add more services.

Personal vs. society account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All SRCF users whether they are society administrators or just looking for web hosting must first get an SRCF account. It is completely fine if you apply for SRCF membership when all you really want is to run your own club's website, rather than your own.
