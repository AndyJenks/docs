About the SRCF
==============

This sections introduces the SRCF, who they are and their aims.

.. rubric:: What is the SRCF?

The SRCF is the University of Cambridge's Student-Run Computing Facility. We provide web hosting, shell accounts and various other computing services to members of the University and groups such as University societies. We are a University society, registered with the Societies Syndicate. As such we are not formally supported by the University Administration in any way; instead the service is maintained by a group of volunteers.

.. rubric:: Who are the SRCF?

The SRCF executive — the `committee <https://www.srcf.net/committee>`__ and sysadmin (system administration) team — consists of current and former University of Cambridge students. We hold elections for the committee positions every year at our AGM, according to our `constitution <https://www.srcf.net/faq/constitution>`__. Any member of the University (staff or student) can `register <https://www.srcf.net/signup>`__ to become a lifetime member of the SRCF, and so use our services. We do not charge any membership fees, or require anything from our members beyond that they abide by our `Terms of Service <https://www.srcf.net/tos>`__.

.. rubric:: Why does the SRCF exist?

The SRCF was formed in 1999 to provide services which the University Administration could not, including web hosting, mailing lists, and other computing resources for student societies. Nowadays, the UIS and many external hosting providers also offer similar services, but none provide as many features at no cost as the SRCF.

Our sysadmins volunteer due to their interest in the GNU/Linux operating system and related software, current server technologies, and to gain valuable experience administering large, multi-user, networked systems. The SRCF also effectively functions as the Linux Users Group (LUG) of the University
