Mailing lists
-------------

We run `Mailman mailing lists <https://lists.srcf.net>`__ for both users and societies.  New lists can be created via the control panel.

The default list administrator is the user's *@srcf.net* for user-owned lists, or the owning society's admin address.  To avoid complicating society account handovers, we recommend you keep this default for society-owned lists, and manage list admins by adding to the society account admin list.  You are free to use the list moderator role to add additional users for approving postings and subscriptions.

To delete a mailing list, you'll need to `contact the sysadmins <https://www.srcf.net/contact>`__.  Unless asked otherwise, we will retain the list archives (though the archives must be public for them to remain accessible).
